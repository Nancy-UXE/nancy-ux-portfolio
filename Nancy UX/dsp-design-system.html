                        Ads Platform Design System was aimed to build a library of reusable components and guidelines that people within Yahoo Ads can combine into interfaces and interactions.

                        Ads Platform Design System, was properly implemented, sped up the design process quite a bit. It also made it so that designers and the rest of the product team can focus more on the flow and logic of a new feature or screen rather than the visual design.

                            Over the years, Yahoo Ads Ads Platform got acquired few times (Brightroll - Yahoo - Verizon - Oath - Apollo). That caused lack any formalized design system.  The design system is needed to empower teams to solve a very broad and varied set of problems, bringing people together is also an important part of ensuring the system is effective for all who rely on it. Encouraging and empowering people to be involved can be a powerful concept for building an inclusive culture too which was not present before introducing the design system.                        </p>

                            Ads Platform team had quite large teams members, spread all over the world, with different project managers, and different styles and future point views. So we needed to build a unified design system that satisfy the different needs, along with that, flexible enough for future enhancements.
                            <br/>With that said, accessibility was a requirement, so we wanted to focus our system around the Web Content Accessibility Standards (WCAG 2.1).

                            The success of the system is the alignment of all our teams on the foundational elements for the different brands. Ads Platform design system is structured to be scaled for both Ads Platform and SSP, and even more, to be applied to other Yahoo channels, meaning that our foundational system needed to account for every potential UI element. Our foundations supported our color palette, brand logos, grid systems, typography , spacing, interactive language, and icons.

                                We introduced a typography that was based on display headings, paragraph styles, utility headings, and supporting different styles. Our color palette allowed for a branded palette that was flexible with different color variations that included the graphs and components interactions states while we maintained a global interactive, neutral, and feedback palette across all the brands for maximum contrast accessibility.
                                <br/><br/>
                                We maintained a consistent design language between brands by ensuring a different variation and states for any button, input, banner and other components. This allowed for more flexibility in element placement on pages with a wider range of background options while maintaining accessibility and optimal contrast.

                            We have built a component library, a collection of reusable interface elements themed by their foundations file. In every part of the design system we reference different component types such as utility, theme, global, responsive design, content, data. It was critical to create variations on each component multiple breakpoints but also layout variations.

                            <br/>Patterns are used to show reusable combinations of components that address common user objectives with flows and sequences. These were developed in consideration of Ads Platform global market, needs and requirements.                         </div><br clear="all"><br>

                                Every component received interaction states examples so that expected user interactions are clearly communicated. These are coupled with detailed specifications around theme, icons, along with other design system foundation’s aspects.                                <br/><br/>
                                Each component is further refined with taking into consideration user feedback, and the limitation of the engineering team. This allowed building a very realistic design system, that could be adapted easily by the engineering side.

                            Design a system that follows accessibility in the first place, test it with  tools to ensure the quality of accessibility, and audit it from time to time to make certain it fits the standards. An accessible design system makes it easier for designers to create products that is available for everyone.
                            <br/>Making digital experiences inclusive for all people is essential. From a business perspective, design system accessibility saves time while increasing consistency, thus creating positive experiences for all users.

                            The future of the design system is to be regarded as a product in its own right, it would be only natural to have a dedicated team to support its functions, which was the case to some extend. Everyone has a real opportunity to contribute to a design system to ensure flexibility and adaptability, because it aims to meet the goals of multiple design and development groups. 

                            <br/>The core design system team was aiming for more future structure regarding: maintain acceptance criteria, share release notes, 		manage reviews for new and updated components, and set up brownbag events for other teams.
