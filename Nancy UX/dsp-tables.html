                        Tables are a great way to display quantitative information, among other usages. Whenever we have more than one set of values that have a direct relationship, we may use a table to organize the data.

                        <br/>
                        For example in Ads Platform tables are used extensively, as we were planning to use the table to look up one or more particular values. Also the information will be used to examine a set of quantitative values as a whole to spot patterns.

                            This feature is an important step towards improving the overall ease of use of the Ads Platform. Currently, on the line grid, Ads Platform users are only able to filter lines using a search box that queries line names or line IDs. This functionality works for basic searches, but doesn’t allow users to perform a more intelligent analysis based on the other data present in the grid. With the Advanced Filters/Search for the Lines Grid release, all Ads Platform users can now apply several filters to the Lines grid, greatly increasing the usability of the grid and all its glorious data!

                            Ads Platform users (and frankly, the internet) are accustomed to drilling down through lots of information to find what they need and have become very efficient at doing so. They want to find things quickly and with the minimum number of clicks. By helping users drill down to their needs with ease, eliminates the need for numerous search queries just to find something specific and also enhances the overall user experience within our platform.

My Contribution: 

You can also simply type in a string or numbers into the search field, press enter, and the Lines grid will perform the relevant search for Line Names and/or Line IDs. Here the default search is line name “contains”.

Each filter has relevant logical operators so that you’re able to narrow down your grid in the ways you would expect. You’re also able to combine filters, ensuring that you quickly find the exact items you’re looking for. Any applied filters have an AND relationship between them.

For example, you can search for a Line Name that contains “retargeting” with a Start Date between 10/5/2020 and 10/20/2020:

Filters are grouped nicely above the grid so that you can easily keep track of what’s applied. If you need to update one of the filters, it’s as simple as clicking on the filter pill and updating your selections. To remove one of the applied filters, you only need to click on the X of the pill.

Also, filters work alongside the Date Selector for the data on the Lines grid. For example, you can change the Date Selector to Previous 7 Days and then add a Spend filter to see what lines spent more than $10,000 in that timeframe.


Operational Workflow

Navigate to the Lines grid underneath a campaign or package. Here you will see the new filters/search box.

Clicking into the input field will expand the list of available filters.

Clicking on a filter will present you with relevant options to customize what you’re filtering for.

Once your filter is set, click Apply.

You can always click Cancel to back out of the current filter.

After a filter is applied, you can open the filter dropdown and select Clear to remove the values and start the filter from scratch.

The filter pill(s) will show up above the Lines grid, and the bottom pane will refresh with the items that match your filter criteria.

From here, you can easily Add, Edit, or Remove filters.

Alternatively, instead of selecting a filter after clicking into the filter/search box, you can type in text or numbers and press enter to start a search.

The dropdown options change depending on if you enter text or numbers:

Note: Pressing enter in either case will perform a contains search for your entry.

                            The introduction of In-Line editing is to improve the overall usability of Ads Platform+ grid views and introduce interactivity within them. This includes workflow improvements for list/grid views on Ads Platform+, focusing more towards - Advertiser, Campaign, and Line list/grid views. This concludes the objective to have all main grid levels of Ads Platform supported in some format with in-line editing capabilities.                        </p>

                            i was part of the team first when we interduced tthe inline-edit concept for users, and we did different explorations, in order to come up with thee besst intuitive experience.
                            
                            workin with the otther tteam members (reseearchers / other ux ) showed how much it is important for users to have such featuree, where it gives a greatt flixabilty to staay in contextt while changing some values. i was included in the users reseearch and thee feeedback cycle.
                            
                            aand that inspired me to take this feeature tto tthe second level,
                            
                            adding to that i took this feature to a second level, where users do not need to go check different values, in order to modify certtain value, tthis needed feew exploratioons from my side, and teesting it with users tto be sure which approach make sense for users, i worked on this feature end to end.

                            so users do not change context

                            Usability testing:

Based on user feedback we chose the final feature’s experience. 

Usability testing indicated, users chose the Exploration 2:

Where the it is simple overlay, that does not complicate the page layout that was in Exploration 1, and i have followed the already existing error validation that done on the page level to save the table row change.

also users praised simplicity in Exploration 2: where no more controls or changee in table structure as showed in Exploration 3 and Exploration 4

Show proper validation message if API throws validation error when Bid Multiplier Max CPM is smaller than Line's max CPM.
This can appear on the Line page, Targeting page, and the bulk edit

AC1 - Bid Multiplier Page - Change "Max Multiplied CPM" to "Max Bid Multiplied CPM"
AC2 - Campaign Lines Page - When inline editing, if the user puts higher CPM value than max bid multiplied CPM, the max bid multiplied CPM component appears with an error message saying 'Max bid multiplied CPM must be greater than CPM price.' User can update CPM price to fix validation error, or they can also update the max bid multiplied price in the little popup component to make it lower to fix validation error. The blue check button (behave as save/update) remains disabled until the user fixes the error.

                            With this release, we bring to the users an easy way to track how their campaigns/lines budget is being spent, how their campaigns have been pacing historically and the current pacing values with data visualization thus helping users to easily monitor overall campaign health. Users will also be able to monitor spend/pacing of schedules in a comprehensive view and in fact edit multiple schedules for an object from the grid itself instead of having to go to the object property page.

                            Users who handle daily campaign operations need a user-friendly management interface to keep track of their campaign delivery . One of the most common tasks is ensuring that campaigns are properly pacing based on the flight dates and pre-defined budgets. Anything a platform can do to assist in making that task easier through helpful visualizations, goes a long way in making the user’s job easier and their experience on our platform delightful.

                                 This feature provides a user-friendly management interface to keep track of campaign delivery, (pacing and spend).

                            <li>Seeing as the current Amazon campaign has spent about $160k in 10 days, the Platform solutions team see Pacing Visualization as a great success and it will have definitely helped improve the stickiness of the Ads Platform.

My Contribution: 

If you are viewing a pacing chart for scheduled budgets, data in the pacing card will be based on the campaign/package/line items which are active during the current budget segment. So the spend/pacing information in the pacing card will be for the current schedule, but lifetime pacing in the grid will be for the entire schedule.

There is a schedule icon that will indicate objects with schedules. Once you click on it, you will be able to view all schedules for that entity.

To view audit log details, you can either click on the button to display budget related changes for the last 15 days or click on the blue dots on individual days on the daily pacing chart to see what changes w.r.t budget/flight was made on that specific day. Audit logs are present for all levels : campaign/package/line.

We have used the following color code to indicate pacing ranges:

GREEN for 90% <LifetimePAcing <110%

YELLOW for 60% <LifetimePAcing <90% OR 110% <LifetimePAcing <130%

RED for 60% > LifetimePacing OR LifetimePacing >130%

                            This feature is one of the most important features that we have added to the tables in Ads Platform. It is a quick view of information, graphs and other data that is important for users to have quick acess to. Very nice about this feature, that it saves a lot of clicks and waiting, in order to view most needed information in one place by one click.
